# cudafun
Cool tech I've always wanted to be able to implement since I was young. This repo will have all of my notes on various textbooks/papers, and the implementation of the various algorithms for cuda on linux, with some additional webgpu implementations (and their deployments) for sharing and visibility. I'm aiming to completely reproduce these algorithms from scratch so that I understand them.

## roadmap
- [ ] normal perceptron neural network
- [ ] convnets
- [ ] ORB slam
- [ ] DTAM
- [ ] transformers
- [ ] gaussian splat renderer
- [ ] gaussian splat learner
- [ ] ASH paper algorithm
- [ ] Fast 2d rigidbody physics from scratch using something like XPBD (extended position based dynamics) implemented on cpu then implemented with cuda
